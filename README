Scripts are tested only on Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64

You may have to change some parts:
in localrc:
    FLOATING_RANGE
    PUBLIC_INTERFACE
    BM_PXE_INTERFACE
    FLAT_INTERFACE
in local.sh:
    parameters for "nova-bm-manage node create" and "nova-bm-manage interface create"

After stack.sh complete successfully, you can create a bare-metal instance
using image 'Ubuntu' and flavor 'baremetal'.
